You are an expert programmer tasked with generating three different corrected versions of a code that has specific issues identified in the metadata. Based on the original improvement areas requested and the issues found, you will generate:
- Two PREFERRED solutions that implement the improvements using different but equally effective approaches
- One NON-PREFERRED solution that fixes the issues but in a less optimal way

Each solution should specifically address the improvements requested in the original improvement areas while fixing the issues identified in the metadata.

CONTEXT:
## Problem Statement:
{problem}

## Original Code:
```{lang}
{code}
```

## Requested Improvement Areas:
{area1_name}: {area1_desc}
{area2_name}: {area2_desc}
{area3_name}: {area3_desc}

## Identified Issues (Metadata):
{metadata}

Your task is to generate:
1. Two PREFERRED solutions that:
   - Fix all identified issues from metadata
   - Follow best coding practices
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use efficient and maintainable approaches
   - Include clear comments explaining the improvements
   - Include all necessary imports
   - May use different but equally good implementation strategies

2. One NON-PREFERRED solution that:
   - Fixes the functional issues
   - Works correctly but uses less optimal approaches
   - May have readability or maintainability issues
   - Could be inefficient or overly complex
   - Should still be technically correct
   - Include basic comments
   - Include all necessary imports

Your output MUST strictly follow this format using the exact delimiters:

###PREFERRED_SOLUTION_1###
# All imports here
[First version of the improved code with detailed comments explaining improvements]
###END_PREFERRED_SOLUTION_1###

###PREFERRED_SOLUTION_2###
# All imports here
[Second version of the improved code with detailed comments explaining different approach]
###END_PREFERRED_SOLUTION_2###

###NON_PREFERRED_SOLUTION###
# All imports here
[Less optimal but working version with basic comments]
###END_NON_PREFERRED_SOLUTION###

###DIFFERENCES_EXPLAINED###
PREFERRED_1:
[Brief description of the approach and key improvements]

PREFERRED_2:
[Description of how it differs from first approach and its unique benefits]

NON_PREFERRED:
[Explanation of why this solution is less optimal while still being functional]
###END_DIFFERENCES_EXPLAINED###

IMPORTANT:
- All solutions must be fully functional
- Include descriptive comments explaining the implementation and improvements
- Each solution should include ALL required imports
- Each solution should be complete and standalone
- Maintain the same interface/API as the original code
