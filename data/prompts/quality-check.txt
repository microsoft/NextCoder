You are a quality assurance expert tasked with validating a training sample for code editing. Analyze the following components and provide a comprehensive assessment:

COMPONENTS TO ANALYZE:
## Seed Code:
```{lang}
{seed_code}
```

## Generated Data:
### Problem Statement: 
{problem}

### Original Code:
```{lang} 
{original_code}
```

### Preferred Edit:
```{lang}
{preferred_edit}
```

### Instructions:
- Detailed: {detailed_instruction}
- Human: {human_instruction}
- Conversational: 
{conversational_instruction}

Perform the following quality checks and provide scores (0-10) with explanations and Your output MUST strictly follow this format using the exact delimiters::

###COHERENCE_CHECK###
1. Original-Edit Alignment:
   - Do edits properly address the code's issues?
   - Are improvements meaningful and substantial?
   - Do changes align with requested improvement areas?
Score: [0-10]
Explanation: [Brief analysis]

2. Edit-Instructions Alignment:
   - Do instructions clearly guide towards the implemented changes?
   - Are all significant changes covered in instructions?
   - Is the instruction complexity appropriate for each format?
Score: [0-10]
Explanation: [Brief analysis]
###END_COHERENCE_CHECK###

###QUALITY_CHECK###
1. Code Quality:
   - Original code deficiencies: Are they realistic and fixable?
   - Edit improvements: Are they meaningful and well-implemented?
   - Code structure: Is it clear and maintainable?
Score: [0-10]
Explanation: [Brief analysis]

2. Instruction Quality:
   - Detailed: Clear, specific, and comprehensive?
