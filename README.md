## Introduction
This repository hosts the official code and data artifact for the paper [NextCoder: Robust Learning of Diverse Code Edits
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03656)

The work is the development of code-editing LLMs, synthetic data generation pipeline and a novel finetuning methodology.

## Repository Structure
- [data](data/): contains the scripts and files required to generate synthetic dataset for code-editing as per the pipeline proposed in the paper
- [train](src/train/) contains the scripts and files for finetuning with SeleKT, LoRA and usual SFT.

## Model Usage
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Microsoft/NextCoder-7B"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = """
Fix the following function that divides two numbers to handle all the edge cases:

def divide(a, b)
  returm a/b
"""
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=1024
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```
